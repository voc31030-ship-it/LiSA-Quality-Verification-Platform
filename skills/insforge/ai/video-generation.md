# Video Generation

Use OpenRouter video models for asynchronous generation jobs. Keep this guide
high level: rely on OpenRouter docs for request/response details, and use
InsForge for job tracking, scheduled polling, Storage, and frontend status.

Official OpenRouter references:

- [Video generation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/overview/multimodal/video-generation)
- [Submit a video generation request](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api/api-reference/video-generation/create-videos)
- [Poll video generation status](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api/api-reference/video-generation/get-videos)
- [List video models](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api/api-reference/video-generation/list-videos-models)
- [Models API](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api-reference/models/get-models)

## Recommended InsForge Flow

1. Start the OpenRouter video job from server-side code only.
2. Store a `video_jobs` row in InsForge with the requesting user, prompt, model,
   OpenRouter job ID, polling URL, status, retry metadata, and storage fields.
3. Poll OpenRouter from server-side infrastructure, such as an InsForge Edge
   Function triggered by an InsForge Schedule.
4. Keep each scheduled invocation bounded. Control how many jobs it polls and
   how many completed videos it downloads/uploads in one run.
5. When a job completes, download the video server-side with
   `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, upload it to InsForge Storage, and save `video_url` and
   `video_key`.
6. Let the frontend read `video_jobs` from InsForge or subscribe via Realtime.
   The browser should never poll OpenRouter or see `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

Use a DB **lease** for in-flight work, not a permanent lock. `lease_owner` plus
`lease_expires_at` communicates that a crashed poller can be retried after the
lease expires.

## Deno Memory

Downloading a video in an Edge Function can buffer the entire MP4 in memory,
depending on the upload path. That can be fine for short, low-resolution clips
when you process only one video per schedule run. For larger videos, use a
Compute worker or a streaming/multipart upload path instead of buffering the
whole file inside Deno.

## Best Practices

1. Use server-side polling as the default baseline.
2. Keep each scheduled invocation bounded with explicit limits and backoff.
3. Store generated videos in InsForge Storage; save both `url` and `key` in the
   database.
4. Store prompt, model, duration, resolution, status, polling URL, errors, retry
   metadata, and Storage references for support/debugging.
5. Use OpenRouter model docs for exact parameters and supported durations,
   sizes, and input formats.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Treating video generation as synchronous | Store a job row and poll from a scheduled server-side function |
| Letting one cron invocation drain the whole queue | Bound each poller run with explicit limits and backoff |
| Polling OpenRouter from the browser | Poll from an InsForge Edge Function or server worker |
| Saving only the OpenRouter content URL | Download server-side, upload to Storage, save `url` and `key` |
| Assuming `unsigned_urls[0]` is a public app URL | Treat it as a server-side download URL and send Authorization |
| Buffering large videos in Deno Edge Functions | Use short clips or move large outputs to Compute/streaming upload |
